<p>MixLab is a game where you have to create new stuff by mixing things. It is extremely easy to play -- just use your common sense and be creative! For example, what do you get when you mix <b>water</b> with <b>fire</b>? That's right, you get <b>steam</b>! Or what do you get when you mix <b>water</b> and more <b>water</b>? You get a lot of water, also known as a <b>sea</b>!</p>

<p>We are planning to add a lot of new features in the future, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>- High scores</li>
	<li>- Awards and badges</li>
	<li>- Cool graphics for all the elements</li>
	<li>- New combinations</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope you enjoy playing MixLab! Please feel free to give <a href="/feedback">feedback</a> to the developers.</p>
